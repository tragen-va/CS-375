# Project Overview

I am creating a game where the player must navigate up a massive tree by jumping or maybe using a grappling hook. 
The goal is to climb as high as possible, navigating branches that serve as platforms. 
The game will use a fixed camera view, keeping the player centered on the screen as they ascend. 
To create the game, I will use JavaScript and Three.js. The environment will include several geometric objects, like tree branches, leaves, and other obstacles. 
Not sure what yet, but I will find models for either the player, branches, or leaves to use. 
The game will feature simple animations for the players movement, branch swaying, and potentially leaf rustling.

# Project Schedule

**Week 1**:  
- Research similar platform games for inspiration.
- Gather resources, including models for tree branches and platforms in GLTF or OBJ format.
- Sketch out the game layout and plan the tree structure.

**Week 2**:  
- Set up the basic scene using Three.js.
- Implement player controls for jumping and grappling mechanics.
- Add collision detection for platforms and other objects.

**Week 3**:  
- Hopefully add textures to models for realistic visual effects.
- Implement lighting to tree branches and leaves.
- Create simple animations for the players movement and dynamic tree elements (e.g., swaying branches).

**Week 4**:  
- Test and refine the gameplay mechanics.
- Prepare the final presentation and walkthrough.

# Project Technical Requirements

- **Graphics API**: Three.js
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Models**: One or more models in GLTF or OBJ format for tree platforms or branches.
- **Animation**: Implement basic animations using Three.js (e.g., transforms for jumping, branch movement).
- **Textures/Lighting**: Use textures for realistic surfaces, and lighting for atmospheric effects.
