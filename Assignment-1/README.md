I found this website on reddit while looking at WebGl websites. This website lets you visualize 3d shaders. The home page is a rendered wharehouse with a big screen where various shadders are displayed. There is also a gallery that showes all of the shaders and lets you see what those would look like in that rendered scenario. All of the shaders shown were made by the shadertoy community and there is a link to view them there. Finally there is an editor that lets you choose one of the shaders from the gallery and edit the code and preview what it looks like. I really like being able to see the shader's rendered in a scene. You get to see how it interects with the other elements and getting to play around with the code and see how the shader chnaged was cool.
